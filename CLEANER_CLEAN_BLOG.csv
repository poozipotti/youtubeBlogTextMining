Monday July 9 2018,The work of trusted journalistic organizations is as critical as ever especially when it comes to seeking information about current events onlineIn March the Google News Initiative GNI We believe quality journalism requires sustainable revenue streams and that we have a responsibility to support innovation in products and funding for newsFor example in 2015 European publishers came to us to ask about how they could scale their video efforts especially because maintaining video delivery infrastructure is costly Working alongside them we launched Player for Publishers a solution that enables news organizations to use YouTube8217s video player to give viewers a worldclass video experience across their own websites and mobile apps Player for Publishers reduces costs and offers improved monetization for news organizationsSince then weve expanded these efforts beyond Europe Today over 100 publishers in more than 25 countries use Player for PublishersAs part of the launch of GNI in March we News organizations interested in more information about these efforts can sign up Authoritativeness is essential to viewers especially during fastmoving breaking news events so we8217ve been investing in new product features to prominently surface authoritative sourcesAfter a breaking news event it takes time to verify produce and publish highquality videos Journalists often write articles first to break the news rather than produce videos That8217s why in the coming weeks in the US we will start providing a short preview of news articles in search results on YouTube that link to the full article during the initial hours of a major news event along with a reminder that breaking and developing news can rapidly changeTo make it easier to find quality news our Top News shelf prominently highlights videos from news sources in search results see the picture below on the left And when a breaking news event happens we want users to know about it That8217s why our Breaking News shelf highlights videos from news organizations about that event directly on the YouTube homepage see the picture below on the right Today our Top News and Breaking News features are launched in 17 countries including the US UK France Italy Japan India Mexico Brazil South Africa Nigeria and more We will double that number in the coming monthsMany people want value and We also believe users should be able to choose and make their own judgments about the information they consume along with context to inform their judgments That8217s why we8217re rolling out a few new features that we will continue to build uponStarting today users will begin seeing information from third parties including Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica alongside videos on a small number of wellestablished historical and scientific topics that have often been subject to misinformation like the moon landing and the Oklahoma City BombingAlong with the Google News Initiative and Googleorg we have teamed up with the Poynter Institute Stanford University Local Media Association and the National Association for Media Literacy Education NAMLE to support MediaWise a USbased initiative designed to equip 1 million teens with digital literacy skills Six incredible YouTube Creators including John Green Ingrid Nilsen and Mark Watson will be working with MediaWise to bring awareness to digital literacy and help educate teensWe remain committed to working with the journalism community to build a more sustainable video ecosystem for news organizations We know there is a lot of work to do but we8217re eager to provide a better experience to users who come to YouTube every day to learn more about what is happening in the world from a diversity of sources Neal Mohan Chief Product

Tuesday September 18 2012,A It was a mix While making the film I put together a flashmob invitation to surprise Caine with customers The flashmob invitation went miniviral hitting reddit8217s front page and HiddenLA8217s facebook page This brought Caine a global community of supporters that were waiting for the film to be finished Once the film was finished I submitted a follow up link to reddit and also sent the link to BoingBoing BoingBoing reposted the film right away and it hit the front page of reddit shortly after Then it just took offA None of us were expecting that level of response I had been hoping to raise 25000 for Caine8217s Scholarship Fund over the course of maybe a year the first day we raised over 100k Caine8217s dad was in tears overwhelmed by phone calls from parents and media around the world he had never experienced that level of kindness from strangers who put together a college fund for his son overnight George was the proudest dad in the world Meanwhile Caine couldn8217t really process how much money had been donated he just knew it was a lot But he was super excited to have so many customers visiting his arcade The first weekend after the film went viral over a thousand people showed up to play There was a 4 hour line stretching around the block 5 months later people still come every day from around the world It8217s amazingA The formation of the foundation was inspired by the global response to the videoAfter the film went viral I didn8217t sleep the first 2 days The response was overwhelming and I was trying to take it all in and absorb as much of the feedback as I could I got emails from thousands of people including videos from kids around the world sharing their creativity I began to think about ways that this project could transition from helping Caine to helping other kids as well On the third day I wrote the mission statement for the Imagination Foundation on a napkin to find foster and fund creativity and entrepreneurship in more kids like CaineWhile the Imagination Foundation wasn8217t something I8217d planned before the film I have worked in the nonprofit space for the past 12 years and have always been interested in the intersection of media and social change So when this happened I knew there was an lightninginabottle opportunity to try and make something that could have an impact for more kids Two days after I wrote the mission statement I connected with the Goldhirsh Foundation who recognized the opportunity to make an impact and put up a 250000 Matching Challenge Grant matching public donations to Caines Scholarship Fund dollarfordollar to help us start the Imagination Foundation To date we have raised 215k of the goalA I met Caine by chance when I went to buy a door handle But there are so many more kids like Caine out there We started the Imagination Foundation to build a discovery platform to help find amazing stories of creative kids like Caine and to then share those stories with the worldWith the Global Cardboard Challenge we are inviting filmmakers and storytellers around the world to document local Cardboard Challenge events on video and to then share those videos with us so we can celebrate the creativity of kids everywhere Send us your videos by October 13th and we will have some cool prizes and opportunities to share the videos with our communityAs we build our community further we plan to continue using video to share inspiring stories of creative kids around the world while inspiring creative actions in line with our missionA I think it is really important to be authentic and personal and to find the details that communicate the heart of your story It8217s also important to have a clear call to action and to keep it simple and engaging The success of videos like Kony 2012 30min and Caine8217s Arcade 11 minutes show that videos don8217t need to be super short to keep people8217s attention If your story is strong your

Thursday August 23 2012,A charity water was born in September and each year we take that month to focus in on a particular country tell an amazing story and challenge our community to make a big impact there This year we8217re telling a It8217s been 18 years since the genocide and the country has been rebuilding faster than most people ever thought possible Rwanda is now attempting to achieve 100 clean water coverage by 2020 something no country in Africa has ever done before and we want to help them By partnering with the local government through the September Campaign we8217re going to bring clean water to 26000 people in the Rulindo DistrictAt the core of this campaign are stories stories of families who have to haul water up and down a mountain every daywater from a swamp or river that can make them sick stories of people making a living by managing and maintaining the kind of water points we8217ll fund and stories of our fundraisers doing amazing things to help people on the other side of the worldIn addition to the trailer which launched on August 21 we8217ll release four short films during the campaign and then on September 7 we8217ll film and upload a video live from Rwanda as the work begins in the field It8217s important to us to inspire our fundraisers by bringing the story to life and also to use video to help them see their impactYes Last year to mark our fifth birthday we decided to celebrate the There was no fundraising goal for these videos and we intentionally didn8217t make them only for our top donors and fundraisers Instead our goal was to just make 250 different supporters feel special and let them know how much we value themOur metrics for the campaign were soft but dozens of people who received the videos sent us emails to express the depth of their feelings and 8216love8217 for our brandAnd our staff everyone from our receptionist to our CTO made videos reported back that this 8216thank you experience8217 was among their favorite moments working hereMost importantly we think that anyone who sees the thank you videos will understand just how much we care about our relationship with our supporters A The first goal of our video strategy is to inspire people Inspire them to become aware of this important issue to donate to fundraise and hopefully to become lifelong fans Inspiration is difficult to measure but the results driven by that inspiration are powerfulFor this year8217s And despite the fact that we don8217t make videos to drive immediate donations we frequently see a fundraising spike alongside our best video content For example last year when we launched our animated Water Changes Everything on YouTube now viewed over 800000 times we saw our online donations spike for weeksA Time energy and talent can be more important than budget when it comes to making great videos Our video team is only made up of a couple people but we invest significant time and energy in bringing excellence to everything we produceIt8217s important to us that charity water videos always look beautiful It shows respect for our supporters that we invest as much time as possible in the highest aesthetic appealA The biggest mistake we see are nonprofits using the power of the medium to drive feelings of guilt or sadness instead of hope and positivityYou can evoke strong emotions with a video and a sad tale or a shocking image can indeed induce someone to pull out their wallet and donate However we believe in respecting both the subjects of our videos and the audience and you8217ll see us continue to focus on

Saturday December 1 2012,More than 34 million people around the globe are living with HIV but only half of those eligible for lifesaving treatment receive it Today on World AIDS Day many organizations are using social media to convey the personal stories of those fighting to end the disease We asked Jeff Davidoff Chief Marketing Officer of Oneorg about their new peoplepowered campaign 8220my story our fight82211 Why did you make video a core component if the my story our fight campaignONE is all about the power of voice As we often say were not asking for you money were asking for you voice And while its true that your voice alone may struggle to be heard or make a difference we have concrete proof that our voices together are impossible to ignore Our over three million members around the world prove this time and again The inspiration for this particular campaign was to get at why people are involved 8212 the personal stories and experiences they have that changed their lives and committed them to getting off the couch and doing some real good in the world To us video was the obvious solution to bring these unique stories to life in a way that people can experience them share them be inspired by them and make their own commitment to action because of them2 You empowered people to share their messages and experiences How did you encourage them to promote the campaigns goals while still allowing the campaign to feel organic and authenticGreat question Authenticity is really at the heart of this idea And the answer is simple dont write scripts Instead just ask people to share their own stories and really push them to open up and be personal I remember asking Cleve Jones Do you have a particular experience or memory that got you started on the path of AIDS activism And he said Absolutely I said Great why dont you sit at my computer and share it And as he shared his beautiful and very personal story right in front of me I knew we were onto something3 What actions are you asking viewers to take and how are you measuring the success of these videos Were using the call to action Watch one Share one Join ONE We want people to be inspired by the stories weve curated share them with their friends and most importantly take action by signing our petition to protect funding for lifesaving AIDS programs Theres a lot of talk now in America about the fiscal cliff This can seem like a vague and distant idea Lets put it in concrete terms if an agreement is not reached and cuts to lifesaving programs goes into a effect real lives will be lost These arent numbers these are people Thats why were in the fight and thats why were hoping more people will join us4 Did you promote the campaign videos outside of YouTube as well How do you think about distribution and helping the videos find their audienceWere aggressively promoting the campaign both inside and outside of YouTube including to our over three million members around the world via email Facebook and Twitter and asking them to share with their much larger social networks Were also rolling out an aggressive PR strategy that matches storytellers to particular audiences 8212 movie stars to entertainment AIDS activists to the AIDS community college students to other students etc Its less about trying to bring people to us and more about trying to get our story embedded in alreadyscaled audiences5 What advice do you have for causebased campaigns in how they approach using YouTubeWeve been through quite a learning curve with YouTube In the beginning I think we had a very oldworld approach by making our own videos and trying to use YouTube as a free broadcast medium Were now much more focused on tapping into the power of existing YouTube creators and getting them to naturally include our message in their stories to their preexisting audiences Its a much more authentic and contemporary use of the medium And were already thrilled with the results  More than 34 million people around the globe are living with HIV but only half of those eligible for lifesaving treatment receive it Today on World AIDS Day many organizations are using social media to convey the personal stories of those fighting to end the disease We asked Jeff Davidoff Chief Marketing Officer of Oneorg about their new peoplepowered campaign 8220my story our fight82211 Why did you make video a core component if the my story our fight campaignONE is all about the power of voice As we often say were not asking for you money were asking for you voice And while its true that your voice alone may struggle to be heard or make a difference we have concrete proof that our voices together are impossible to ignore Our over three million members around the world prove this time and again The inspiration for this particular campaign was to get at why people are involved 8212 the personal stories and experiences they have that changed their lives and committed them to getting off the couch and doing some real good in the world To us video was the obvious solution to bring these unique stories to life in a way that people can experience them share them be inspired by them and make their own commitment to action because of them2 You empowered people to share their messages and experiences How did you encourage them to promote the campaigns goals while still allowing the campaign to feel organic and authenticGreat question Authenticity is really at the heart of this idea And the answer is simple dont write scripts Instead just ask people to share their own stories and really push them to open up and be personal I remember asking Cleve Jones Do you have a particular experience or memory that got you started on the path of AIDS activism And he said Absolutely I said Great why dont you sit at my computer and share it And as he shared his beautiful and very personal story right in front of me I knew we were onto something3 What actions are you asking viewers to take and how are you measuring the success of these videos Were using the call to action Watch one Share one Join ONE We want people to be inspired by the stories weve curated share them with their friends and most importantly take action by signing our petition to protect funding for lifesaving AIDS programs Theres a lot of talk now in America about the fiscal cliff This can seem like a vague and distant idea Lets put it in concrete terms if an agreement is not reached and cuts to lifesaving programs goes into a effect real lives will be lost These arent numbers these are people Thats why were in the fight and thats why were hoping more people will join us4 Did you promote the campaign videos outside of YouTube as well How do you think about distribution and helping the videos find their audienceWere aggressively promoting the campaign both inside and outside of YouTube including to our over three million members around the world via email Facebook and Twitter and asking them to share with their much larger social networks Were also rolling out an aggressive PR strategy that matches storytellers to particular audiences 8212 movie stars to entertainment AIDS activists to the AIDS community college students to other students etc Its less about trying to bring people to us and more about trying to get our story embedded in alreadyscaled audiences5 What advice do you have for causebased campaigns in how they approach using YouTubeWeve been through quite a learning curve with YouTube In the beginning I think we had a very oldworld approach by making our own videos and trying to use YouTube as a free broadcast medium Were now much more focused on tapping into the power of existing YouTube creators and getting them to naturally include our message in their stories to their preexisting audiences Its a much more authentic and contemporary use of the medium And were already thrilled with the results

Wednesday March 6 2013,Greetings it is I the Count Von Count from Sesame Street It is a pleasure to be blogging to you today because when I blog I get to count the words That is 31 31 wonderful words in my blog post ahhahaToday I want to pay tribute to one of my favorite numbers What number is it I am glad you asked Today I pay tribute to the number zero A surprising number I know For when you have zero there is nothing to count So why do I a person who loves to count love the number zeroWell for one thing zero comes in very handy when there is nothing around to count For you can count zero of that thing Like right now as I look around the castle I count zero elephants zero airplanes and zero Justin Bieber CDs WonderfulBut that is not the only reason to love zero For you see zero can make a little number much bigger How Like so8212say you have a little number 1 a very nice number indeed But when you take that one and put a zero next to it all of a sudden you have 10 10 wonderful things to count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 8211 ten little fingers on your hands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 8211 ten little toes on your feet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 8211 ten little hot dogs in the meat drawer of my refrigerator Oh I love counting to tenBut that is not all that zero can do Take that 10 and put another zero on the end and suddenly you have 100 100 is a glorious number to count I can count 100 seats in a movie theater I count 100 golf balls at the golf course I count 100 senators in the US Senate I love counting to 100Now what if you take that 100 and place another glorious zero beside it Then all of a sudden you have 1000 1000 is an extraordinary number to count You can count 1000 seashells on the seashore 1000 paperclips in Bert8217s paperclip collection 1000 hairs growing out of your uncle8217s ear I love counting to 1000Let8217s not stop there Let8217s add three zeros to that 1000 and all of a sudden we have 1000000 things to count Have you ever counted to 1 million I did When I worked for the census bureau in Rhode Island You should try it one time or every four years your choiceNow take that 1000000 and add three more wonderful zeroes and what do you get I8217ll tell you you get a number so big so great and so huge When you have nine zeroes after a 1 you get the number 1000000000 Yes 1 billion things to count And it is all thanks to that lovely number zero Thank

Sunday September 19 2010,The Life in a Day project is entirely based on capturing a single day on earth through the eyes of thousands of different people around the worldnbspWe sat down with LG8217s Brand Manager Jackie Pyo to talk about why LG chose to partner with Life in a Day1 LG is always looking out for innovative projects and groundbreaking ideas that support our company vision that technology can make life better 8211 that it can make life good YouTube is a company that uses technology to help people learn more about each other build better relationships with one and other and in doing so ultimately enrich our livesWhen we first heard about the Life in a Day project we knew immediately that this was going to be a chance to bring our company vision to life and deliver something special to millions of people around the world What started as just the seed of an idea has grown into one of our most exciting partnerships to date Because we were involved at the very beginning we8217ve been able to work collaboratively with YouTube to shape the direction of the project and help to make Life in a Day a fantastic success while staying true to the core essence of the LG brand2Other sponsorships we8217ve done in the past and are doing today all associate LG with phenomenal properties 8211 properties people love 8211 that help us connect with people on an intimate emotional level Life in a Day is no exception but the difference between Life in a Day and our other marketing activities is that it has never been done before 8211 the journey is new both for LG and for the people who join in In this respect it8217s a completely new path for LG and we hope we can show people what we really stand for along the way 3 Our brand has four core values Humanity Pleasure Curiosity and an Optimistic Energy So whenever we do any marketing we always ask ourselves 8220Is it truly representative of 8216Life8217s Good82178221 It8217s our litmus test for everything we do4 We wanted to present the Life in a Day Gallery because we were fascinated not only by the sheer volume of entries the project received but the way the entries were tagged Each of the 80000 entries has its own story and no one story is more or less important than the next We worked with YouTube to create the Gallery to showcase all the entries in one place These personal emotional stories 8211 the entries 8211 are important to us It8217s what excited us most about the project The Gallery brings the stories to the users and the users to the stories That8217s the real emotional engagement 8211 between the people in the films and the people watching the films Our role in facilitating this emotional engagement provides LG with a great opportunity to engage with both the participants and the viewers on a personal levelWhat really surprised us with the tagging is that so many videos were illustrating positive messages Thousands of people wanted to tell the world about the good things in life To celebrate this we created the Smile Gallery but we also want to give these people the chance to create a video about their favorite 8220Life8217s Good When82308221 moment in a LG promotion

almost like a window 8211 a window to an engaged audience We shouldn8217t forget that YouTube is still only 5 years old and lots of brands tend to rush into new platforms without thinking about how they8217re actually adding value We didn8217t want to do that so we always looked on and just wanted to wait for the right opportunity an opportunity that worked for LG worked for YouTube but most

Tuesday September 14 2010,For EC Hundley his dream had four wheels an engine and a smooth ride As the proprietor of Oddly enough we started out as a local retail store and we never thought about taking our business online After the first 8 months we were going broke with just one employee and I figured we had to do something if we were going to surviveYes At that point we had maybe 1500 in inventory sitting on the shelf so we started putting some of it on eBay We then got with a friend who8217s a web designer and he built our website Since then we have revamped the site about four times to make it friendly for our customers It saved our businessOur direct web activity is about 70 of our sales Most of the rest is via telephone and we also promote our business via a print catalogI help people with installation of the products we sell Our call volume had gotten really high on some of our products so helping people over the phone was taking a lot of time Then I remembered watching a Photoshop tutorial on YouTube and I thought to myself this is the answer to our problem So we started shooting a few howto videos and posted them on our YouTube channel and soon those calls stopped completelynbspDo the videos help you sell more tooYes The videos also help us earn new business because our customers can see that we know the products we sell and they can buy with confidenceWith the success we8217ve had with the few videos we have done we have now built a studio just for shooting howto videos This way the customer can see how the products are installed and get a better idea of how it is going to look One of the toughest parts of selling a product online is that the customer usually just gets to see a picture of what they8217re interested in With video they get a better idea of the real look and size It is the closest thing you can get to seeing touching feeling the productIt was the easiest Internet task we had ever done It8217s pretty easy and inexpensive to make goodlooking videos today tooThe main advantage of producing online videos especially for an online business is it makes your business real Customers need to see that your company has real people behind the website

Saturday August 21 2010,Were always inspired by the people who use YouTube as a way to document how the other half lives and Mark Horvath is a great example As the founder of Sixteen years ago I had a very good job in the television industry Fifteen years ago I became homeless living on Hollywood Boulevard I rebuilt my life to a point where I had a threebedroom house and a 780 credit score then in 2007 the economy took a nosedive Like many Americans I found myself unemployed living off my credit cards and hoping for the best The best never came but several layoffs 8212 along with foreclosure on my house 8212 didBy November 2008 I found myself once again laid off I was mentally and emotionally exhausted and to be honest I was scared of once again living on the streets of Hollywood I could see homelessness all around me but I couldn8217t bear to look I was turning away because I felt their painDont waste a good crisis It8217s a simple concept and it8217s how I honestly didnt think anyone would even view the videos I was really doing it to release something that was deep down inside me and to be candid to keep busy It was a really dark time and InvisiblePeople tv gave me a purposeIll never forget going into the first tent city It was 400 yards in a wooded area where no help could easily arrive if I found myself in trouble I questioned my sanity walking in there with a camera and a bag of socks One smart thing I did was blast what I was doing all over social media so people could feel like they were right there with me That day my life changed People started to tweet me encouragement and all kinds of support The InvisiblePeople tv road trip was bornLast year I traveled 11236 miles around the US in a threemonth period I went under bridges into tent cities and walked through many shelters and rundown hotels There was no way anyone could foresee the impact I became a catalyst for change in several communities Housing programs were started feeding programs were started 50 homeless kids who could not go to school because they didnt have shoes suddenly had brand new shoes within an hour of my visit thanks to social media A farmer even donated 40 acres of land that is now even being used to supplement low income families in a local school I could go on and onI am a storyteller I also empower people to tell their own stories Not sure you could frame me as a citizen journalist or activist even though there are elements to both in what I do Beth Kanter coins the term Free Agent in her book 8220Last year I met Angela who is living under a bridge in Atlanta and she changed me She is dying under that bridgeWhen I asked what was being done to help her the response I received was We bring her sandwiches8221 Sandwiches are not enough Up to that point I thought that people should do whatever they can do to help 8211 even if it8217s just baking cookies After meeting Angela I realized people need housing jobs and health services So maybe your support level is just baking cookies Thats fine But dont just randomly hand them out Take your cookies to an organization that is providing housing jobs and health servicesThe 1 rule is respect everyone I never force a story In fact the best stories are the ones I never get on camera Thats kind of why I dont feel citizen journalist fits me I honestly put people before the storyI also use socks to break the ice Socks on the streets are like gold Almost all organizations churches or groups will feed homeless people In most parks where homeless hang out churches will feed the same people all day long but rarely are socks handed out By handing a homeless person a clean pair of socks even without saying a word they know I know a thing or two about street lifeOnce someone agrees to an interview and the camera is recording I simply do my best to be a good listener Thats not always easy when my heart gets wreckedBack years ago working as a TV producer if an interview went dry I would distract and refocus by asking people their three wishes When I first started InvisiblePeople tv I did it once in a while I didnt know the impact that question had on the viewers Then last year when I spoke at the University of Arkansas the organizer secretly had everyone in the audience write on large white poster board their three wishes When I was done speaking they all held them up to show me Talk about a powerful memory From that moment on I have asked everyone what their three wishes areMy first wish would be that people really see the reality of homelessness second that we develop communities and work as a team to solve this social crisis The third I would like security and normalcy in my life but with a name like Please always remember the homeless people you8217ll ignore today were much like

Friday August 13 2010,I was at the Istanbul airport standing with my luggage next to a very long escalator I had nothing to do I was just intensely watching the handrail when suddenly I thought 8220Hey I can use it for an animation8221 Then I realized how easy it could have been sticking on the handrail Also in that period I was studying the great work of So when I came home from the airport I made a test with the stickers as I was not so sure about the result But actually it was working I liked the images and I decided to develop a full abstract movie I started to prepare all the shapes and stickers without having a script or even thinking about a story I just wanted to use this public space and play with it as a kid letting my imagination flow Having fun in the creative process is very important for me that8217s the only way I know to do something fresh something that could catch the audience unpreparedThe escalator animation could be considered as the following chapter of I started preparing all the papers shapes for each one of them I did nine different sizes so that when they moved on the steps you can also see the dimension changing Then I went shooting for a full day with four friends of mine A friend and I were on the bottom of the escalator and we were just leaning the shapes on the steps that were going up and another friend stayed on top sending the shapes back on the steps that were going down On the opposite side the camera man Jacopo was shooting just the side where the escalator was going upIt was a very funny day actually The escalator was located close to a university and it was full of students that got really surprised Some students even asked me if they could take some hearts or clouds Then I drew all the animations on the stickers and I went to the escalator a few times during the night while it was stopped We pasted the stickers on the handrail and then in the morning we went back there to shoot them Actually I had lots of troubles due to the winter cold the stickers didn8217t stick to the handrail Building all the materials and shooting took me about two months and editing the longest part about three months Ive also spent one week preparing the soundtrack So in the end the whole work took me about six monthsFirst off I was fascinated by the hypnotic movement of the escalator it runs all day long in the same way I wanted to break this repetition with a kind of game and let people imagine public spaces in a different way more funny and more creative I like to imagine this world as a place with no rules where you can act more freely and take life less seriously Another reason is that I wanted to mix my passion for animation with my passion for urban installationDuring one of the shooting days a police officer came to us asking what were we doing and if we had a permission We said we were just shooting a commercial for a very famous Italian pop band At this point he said he loved them and left without even asking to see the permission I will go on working in public spaces The final result always surprises me When you make experimental videos a lot of problems come up that you never thought about before until its done you dont really know where youre going Maybe you start with an idea and then its not going fine so you have to change everything I already started drawing a new animation with a script and it will be done on a common object that people use everyday Cant say more until its done It will be a surprise  I was at the Istanbul airport standing with my luggage next to a very long escalator I had

then a blog and just a few years ago we started producing original This episode of Boing Boing Video is a special one featuring rare and historic film from Mardi Gras in New Orleans Louisiana from 1956 Artist Mar Dore stumbled on a box of slides in her familys home in Texas and inside discovered photographs that her father took of the parades in the era of Mad Men that box like a time capsule she says opened a door into history We worked with her to retell that story in videoMy interview with actor and comedian Peter Serafinowicz Hes starring as Paul McCartney in the Robert Zemeckis remake of the Beatles Yellow Submarine his Mac parody ads are the stuff of viral legend his PSQA tweets delight mutants throughout the globe and fans of his BBC show find much to LOL in the likes of Brian Butterfield and the robot talk show host Michael6This Swell Season feature is one of the most visually beautiful episodes weve ever produced of Boing Boing Video Irish musician Glen Hansard and Czech singer and pianist Markéta Irglová speak with us and perform an unreleased song for us during their current US tourThis Boing Boing Video episode documents an experiment from PopSci columnist Theo Grays book MAD SCIENCE Using prosciutto and an air hose Mr Gray constructs a high performance thermic lance that can slice sheet metal In this video youll also see a purely vegan thermic lance built from one cucumber and several dozen thin vegetableoil coated breadsticks If you like this you may also enjoy Back in 2008 we did a series of episodes in which John Hodgman did dramatic readings of actual spam emails received by Boing Boing editors This ones my favorite These were so much fun to put together Related this sneakattack on Hodgman in his hotel while he was writing Music legend David Byrne transformed an entire NYC building into a giant musical instrument We explored that building with him in this Boing Boing TV episode and discovered some crazy gems of urban archeology togetherIts not every day that we get to travel to remote stretches of African wilderness to tweet about baboons and videoblog elephants But this episode documents one such day its an ambient exploration of the creatures rustling around in a West African wildlife preserve at dawnThis episode in our BBtv WORLD series was comprised of video shot by Kiche people in a Maya village in the highlands of Guatemala The world they see around them through their own eyes and in their own language Some of what the children shot really surprised me They caught on right away faster even than the adults and quickly taught each other how to record and play back video Some of them seemed to transform into instant YouTube stars new alteregos showed up out of nowhere One boy wed come to know as quiet and wellmannered over the course of many previous visits here shot himself throwing gang signs against the sunlight like shadow puppets while he walked a path that leads to a Mayan altar Another girl who was very shy with us in person recorded video of herself making outrageous silly faces and speaking in a boisterous confident voice to her new handheld lens Two related episodes you might enjoy also shot in the pueblo in Guatemala This was one of our first Boing Boing TV episodes and its still one of my favorites So Furries get no respect Usually when you hear about people who dress up

moments in Iran it all has a home on YouTube This creates a really big challenge how do we design a site that reflects so many different users experiences and videos This is a question weve thought about a lot since we launched in 2005 The result of some of this thinking some might say overthinking is a video page chockfull of features that reflect a lot of different things to a lot of different people but can feel cluttered and a little overwhelming Weve spent a lot of time over the last 10 months asking ourselves some tough questions about this page and posing some of those questions to you in blog posts roundtable discussions oneonone conversations with the community and even on forums like our pageToday were excited to unveil the first major example of our efforts to simplify and streamline the video page to offer the best possible watching experience to you To check out this new look all you have to do is optin Click on Well be making the optin more easily accessible soon but we wanted to give our most passionate users a chance to experiment with it early Below are some highlights of some of the things that have changed and why You can also check out our in the Help Center This concept is at the heart of the redesign YouTube is about creating and watching the worlds biggest video collection therefore the design should make the video the star To that end the new look is more subdued stripped down and simple than before The design should help ease users into advanced features while providing power users with all the functionality they want  Well be smarter about queuing up other videos for you to watch on the right side of the page that will take into consideration how you found a video For example if you arrived at a video through Search the rest of the search results will follow you to the playback page so your can continue to browse search results on the video page The same goes for playlists and recommendations if thats how you found a video then thats what will show up on the right side of the page Again this is about creating a consistent viewing experience and a relevant one when we include context about your viewing intentions Description and stats areas united More specific information about the video youre watching is now in one place on the page underneath the video Click on the Description snippet or the Views to see more This new expand capability works on multiple elements of the page so you wont have to learn a new trick to view each piece of data The result less clutter especially on the right side where you look for the next video to watch Actions like sharing rating saving or flagging a video are now all grouped in one place with a cleaner simpler button bar We thought a lot about practicality here choosing to expose only the most commonly used actions and language for you And Playlists can now be built via the Save to pulldown menu the rating system on YouTube doesnt really work that well eg only the 1 and 5 star ratings were ever really used So we moved towards a simpler Like Dont Like model Liking a video will also save it to your Favorites to make it easy to find those videos again  Were adding a new size control into the player that allows you to pick a larger size to watch your video formally above the player When you pick the size well serve you the ideal quality For those of you hungry for more control you can pick the specific video quality for example SD HD or 1080p in an associated dropdown menu Well warn you when we think there may be a better quality choice but the control is in your hands Now you can now search while youre watching a video and results will appear on the right side of the video page without interrupting the viewing experience Subscriptions are important to many of you so weve made it more noticeable by moving the Subscribe button to the top of the video right near the title This also gives anyone the ability to quickly peek at more videos from the creators channel Just click on the arrow next to the number of uploads on the persons channel to see more videos from that user Youve told us that making you hunt for this information on the page is confusing and many of you wanted this data in one place This should make it easier to discover more content from videographers you likeSo those are just a few things youll find in this new video page experience As with all things on the Web and in life change is hard and can take some time to get used to Thats why we did a lot of research talked with so many of you and incorporated your thoughts

we are being hit from every side I just ask how these candidates will fix this national problem that the companies are creating in the name of bad economic times the loop hole being exploited by them has to stop it has to be a way to make the temporary agencies accountable for the indiscriminate abuse of our unemployed people just think about it they are in a limbothese unemployed people are getting about 6570 of the real pay amount that the company pays and with no benefits or way to show as a permanent worker So if some of these people employed for the temporary agency want to buy a house car or get a loan they do not qualify because their status of temporary workers In the mean time the temporary agency and the company are profiting from the misfortune of our fellow citizen the company do not pay all the normal taxation to have a regular permanent job in they payroll even this government of Obama is gaining more adepts to the dependent people from government because these people with no insurance they are the perfect candidates for the Obama health care AS YOU CAN SEE EVERY ONE INVOLVE GETS A PROFIT AT EXPENSES OF OUR FELLOW UNEMPLOYED CITIZEN THIS IS THE REAL MESS SO

dominated YouTube8217s charts all year with no signs of slowing Currently six of the top ten music videos on YouTube8217s charts are by Latin artists with tracks like J Balvin8217s 8220Mi Gente8221 looking like they might give 8220Despacito8221 a run for its recordbreaking moneyArriving right on cue is Ozuna who for the past three weeks has reigned at the top slot of the global YouTube Artists

explains 8220It is the most important platform to reach the entire world8221Writing his first song at the young age of 12 Ozuna found early inspiration from other Puerto Rican artists who turned to

reggaeton was known for in the mid821700s the album8217s distinct sound 8212 replete with glowing trap beats arresting dembow rhythms and Ozuna8217s unmistakable falsetto 8212 resonated far beyond San

Monday January 23 2017,In December 2007 Cara Brookins was a 36yearold computer programmer working full time and taking care of her four young kids ages 2 11 15 17 From the outside she looked like any other mom but personally she had just closed the door on an unsafe marriage and was preparing to rebuild her lifeAfter buying an acre of land in Bryant Ark and taking out a 150k loan Cara and her four kids did something amazing 8230 they rolled up their sleeves and started building their own home with the help of YouTube videos The videos they watched on YouTube equipped them with the information they needed to make their big dream a reality They watched videos to learn everything from how to build a solid foundation and construct countertops to even how to do their own plumbing By September 2008after nine months of working 20hour daysCara and her kids had finished their dream home We spoke with Cara about finding hope the power of YouTube and why she chose to share her storyCara I had left a domestic violence situation with my four kids and we were really emotionally destroyed All the advice I found for improving my life talked about baby steps and small goals I couldn8217t see how just resolving to get dressed in the morning was going to get me anywhere We needed a safe place to live and I was determined to do something big So building a house felt like the most natural solution in the worldCara We had always had a DIY mindset and we8217d used YouTube to make our own jewelry and art projects So we instantly focused on YouTube as the place to also learn how to set a foundation block or how to frame a window I also researched energy efficient building ideas on YouTube YouTube was really our goto destination for the information we needed throughout the processCara My parents thought I was absolutely nuts They tried to talk me out of it and that shocked me It seemed like such an obvious and perfect solution Of course once they saw I was going to build it anyhow8212yes they already knew I was a very stubborn girl8212they supported me in every way even showing up on the job site to workCara We used multiple videos for each project to learn multiple ways to do each thing like frame a window or run a sewer line And we tried to understand why each thing was done a certain way rather than just how to do it Because we were watching at home on a computer no smartphones and would have to remember everything to make it work the next day on the job siteCara From the day we broke ground I thought this every single day until we moved in It was an overwhelming number of decisions and amount of work But I was the only adult to pull all the kids together and I had to play it confident and cool the whole time I had to make the decisions and plans and then be the cheerleader It was emotionally exhausting but of course incredibly rewarding tooCara Never stop with the phrase 8220I don8217t know how to do that8221 Always add 8220YET8221 There are no limits to what you can accomplish if you truly want it And of course that8217s because if you want it badly enough you8217ll put in a solid effort and endless hours of hard work Approach each project with steady determination I was a small computer programmer and an author If I can build a house with my kids there is no limit to what other people might accomplishCara I never intended to write a book about the house when we were building it I was pretty ashamed that my decisions had put us in this place where our sanest option was to build our own shelter Fiction writing was my big focus at the time But after we finished I knew I had to tell our story not because I wanted other people to look at what we8217d done but because I wanted them to imagine the big things they could build with their life It took me six years to figure out how to write the book in the right away I had dozens of versions before 8220Rise8221 sold Even then there was a big fear over how people would react and what they would focus on in the story It8217s such a vulnerable time of our lives to share But we8217ve had so much support from across the entire world and best of all the message people are receiving is that they really can do anything they dream of if they put in enough hard workCara My kids were so weak and small when we started this project All our energy went toward survival with no energy left for setting goals or dreaming of a big future After we built the house we each came away with the sense that absolutely anything was possible Our dreams are ridiculous crazy things and we don8217t doubt for one second that we8217ll achieve them  In December 2007 Cara Brookins was a 36yearold computer programmer working full time and taking care of her four young kids ages 2 11 15 17

Thursday June 29 2017,Everyday young professionals in India move out of their small towns to the big cities in search of their dream jobs and to earn a steady income Srinath and Laxman did the same and they were employed by a well established media company earning a good income to take care of their families back homeThey lived together in a small rented apartment and cooked on their own They made their traditional recipes but frequently used YouTube to try out new cuisines They were awestruck to see the millions of views for recipe videos on YouTube With a background in post production they decided to explore the opportunity for themselves and in August 2016 launched a traditional Indian recipes channel on YouTubeDespite concerns from their families they quit their jobs and decided to pursue this as a fulltime career When they partnered with Laxman8217s 106yearold grandmother Mastanamma their channel skyrocketed Her delicious traditional recipes have received audience attention all around the world We spoke with Srinath about their passion for food the power of YouTube and what lies aheadWhen I first told my wife about my plans to quit my job to start a YouTube channel she was not very happy At the time I had a good job and a decent salary we also have kids so she was not supportive of my decision and didn8217t understand why I wanted to do this But both Laxman and I were convinced that we wanted to do this so we quit our jobs and started the channel and became YouTube creatorsWe were blessed that our channel started doing well pretty quickly and we started making a similar amount of money as we were in our past jobs This gave my family some confidence in what I was doing But after four months we realized that we needed to do something different to sustain our growthWe were visiting Laxman8217s village called Gudiwada and since it8217s a small village everybody was aware of our YouTube channel They were all very happy for us but they had no idea that we were looking for new ideas to build on our startThat8217s when Laxman8217s mother suggested that we should try the recipes of Laxman8217s grandmother Mastanamma because she makes really authentic and delicious dishes At first we didn8217t think much of it but we decided to try her food Her food was amazing and it was not like anything we had tried before so we decided to record a few videos with herOur first video with her was a hit and received 3 million views We uploaded another video titled 8220Having a YouTube channel has given her new experiences that none of us ever thought were possible She was even recently interviewed by the BBC She doesn8217t completely realize what she has created but it8217s something that is connecting people all around the world We now visit her once a month and shoot new videos for two or three days of the newest recipes she wants to share on YouTubeWe never expected to come this far but we8217re delighted that we took a chance and our families are now very happy and supportive of our work Our income has also gone up tremendously and our viewership comes from all over the world We want to build on this success and are already working on a new animation channel for kids and families We8217re excited to create something unique in that space as wellShe says that there is no better food than the food you make yourself Everyone should learn to cook because it8217s healthier and brings people together  Everyday young professionals in India move out of their small towns to the big cities in search of their dream jobs and to earn a steady

couldn8217t just film the videos during store hours anymore the foot traffic had picked up And it was coming from everywhereBy 2012 we had over 25000 subscribers and we were regularly getting visitors to Missouri Star from around the world Our sales were growing quickly and we decided to use the money we were earning to help invest in our community One by one I had seen businesses in Hamilton pack up and leave as the recession got worse and I wanted to change that trend We decided to buy up a few of those boardedup buildings to give our visitors an even richer experienceWe opened a store for Civil Warera prints a store for modern quilt fabric a store for novelty patterns and still we kept growing Today Hamilton is the Disneyland of quilting We have 12 quilting stores operating in Hamilton and we get busloads of visitors coming to our small town almost every week We didn8217t just stop at quilting either We8217ve partnered with talented chefs cooks and bakers in our community to help them open their own business In small town of 1800 Missouri Star Quilt now employs over 400 peopleI remember having a dance party with my family when we sold seven orders in one day Now we ship as many as 5000 orders a day Missouri Star Quilt Company has grown from one woman with a quilting machine to the largest seller of precut quilting fabric in the world and the biggest employer in our countyNone of that could have been possible without YouTube Our channel allowed us to turn our small business into a global business We now have over 350000 subscribers on YouTube from countries throughout the worldBut as great as all those numbers are the thing that makes me happiest is what I did in that very first video teach someone how to quilt I8217ve been lucky to find something I truly love to do and I8217m so happy YouTube has given me the opportunity to share that passion with others It8217s meant the world to my small business to my community and to meJenny Doan  In 2009 my new quilting business was struggling to get off the ground The recession had hit my family and my town of Hamilton Mo pretty hard and I had started Missouri Star Quilt Company as a way to earn retirement money while doing something I loved But like almost every small business at the time Missouri Star wasn8217t setting the world on fire To help get the word out my son Al suggested we film some tutorials and post them to YouTube8220Sure8221 I told him 8220What8217s a tutorial8221Back then I had never even visited YouTube but I decided to try it out I set up my sewing machine in a corner of the shop and Al began to shoot our first video on a handheld camera We didn8217t even bother to close the shop because foot traffic was so slow Those first videos didn8217t always look super spiffy but I think people appreciated that I was making a hobby that sometimes feels intimidating to learn more approachableWeek by week we filmed new tutorials and though it took a little while we started seeing our views and subscriber numbers go up First we hit 1000 subscribers then 10000 subscribers And while our online following was growing we started getting some new visitors in real life too People were popping into our store from as far away as Texas Virginia and Mexico telling me how they8217d seen our videos on YouTube and wanted to visit me in person We couldn8217t just film the

Monday December 4 2017,As the CEO of YouTube I8217ve seen how our open platform has been a force for creativity learning and access to information I8217ve seen how activists have used it to advocate for social change mobilize protests and document war crimes I8217ve seen how it serves as both an entertainment destination and a video library for the world I8217ve seen how it has expanded economic opportunity allowing small businesses to market and sell their goods across borders And I8217ve seen how it has helped enlighten my children giving them a bigger broader understanding of our world and the billions who inhabit itBut I8217ve also seen upclose that there can be another more troubling side of YouTube8217s openness I8217ve seen how some bad actors are exploiting our openness to mislead manipulate harass or even harmIn the last year we took actions to protect our community against violent or extremist content testing new systems to combat emerging and evolving threats We tightened our policies on what content can appear on our platform or earn revenue for creators We increased our enforcement teams And we invested in powerful new machine learning technology to scale the efforts of our human moderators to take down videos and comments that violate our policiesNow we are applying the lessons we8217ve learned from our work fighting violent extremism content over the last year in order to tackle other problematic content Our goal is to stay one step ahead of bad actors making it harder for policyviolating content to surface or remain on YouTubeHuman reviewers remain essential to both removing content and training machine learning systems because human judgment is critical to making contextualized decisions on content Since June our trust and safety teams have manually reviewed nearly 2 million videos for violent extremist content helping train our machinelearning technology to identify similar videos in the future We are also taking aggressive action on comments launching new comment moderation tools and in some cases shutting down comments altogether In the last few weeks we8217ve used machine learning to help human reviewers find and terminate hundreds of accounts and shut down hundreds of thousands of comments Our teams also work closely with NCMEC the IWF and other child safety organizations around the world to report predatory behavior and accounts to the correct law enforcement agenciesWe will continue the significant growth of our teams into next year with the goal of bringing the total number of people across Google working to address content that might violate our policies to over 10000 in 2018At the same time we are expanding the network of academics industry groups and subject matter experts who we can learn from and support to help us better understand emerging issuesWe will use our cuttingedge machine learning more widely to allow us to quickly and efficiently remove content that violates our guidelines In June we deployed this technology to flag violent extremist content for human review and we8217ve seen tremendous progressBecause we have seen these positive results we have begun training machinelearning technology across other challenging content areas including We understand that people want a clearer view of how we8217re tackling problematic content Our We8217re also taking actions to protect advertisers and creators from inappropriate content We want advertisers to have peace of mind that their ads are running alongside content that reflects their brand8217s values Equally we want to give creators confidence that their revenue won8217t be hurt by the actions of bad actorsWe believe this requires a new approach to advertising on YouTube carefully considering which channels and videos are eligible for advertising We are planning to apply stricter criteria conduct more manual curation while also significantly ramping up our team of ad reviewers to ensure ads are only running where they should This will also help vetted creators see more stability around their revenue It8217s important we get this right for both advertisers and creators and over the next few weeks we8217ll be speaking with both to hone this approachWe are taking these actions because it8217s the right thing to do Creators make incredible content that builds global fan bases Fans come to YouTube to watch share and engage with this content Advertisers who want to reach those people fund this creator economy Each of these groups is essential to YouTube8217s creative ecosystem8212none can thrive on YouTube without the other8212and all three deserve our best effortsAs challenges to our platform evolve and change our enforcement methods must and will evolve to respond to them But no matter what
